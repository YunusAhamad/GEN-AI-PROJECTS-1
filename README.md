# GenAI Text Generation Project Using GPT-2

## Project Overview
This project presents a **Generative Artificial Intelligence text generation system** implemented using the **GPT-2 transformer model**. The solution generates coherent and context-aware text based on user-provided input, demonstrating the practical application of modern Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a clear and practical understanding of **text generation using pre-trained transformer models**, with a focus on simplicity, reproducibility, and educational value.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Hugging Face Transformers Library**
- **GPT-2 Pre-trained Language Model**

## Execution Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in **Google Colab**
2. Install the required Python dependencies
3. Execute all cells in sequential order
4. Provide an input text prompt when prompted
5. Review the generated AI-based text output

## Project Structure
- **genai_text_generator.ipynb** – Core implementation of the text generation model  
- **README.md** – Project documentation

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the fundamentals of **Generative AI and text generation**
- Practical exposure to **transformer-based language models**
- Hands-on experience with the **Hugging Face pipeline architecture**
- Ability to implement and test **pre-trained NLP models**

## Potential Applications
- Automated content generation systems
- AI-assisted writing tools
- Text completion and summarization workflows
- Educational demonstrations of Generative AI concepts

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational implementation of **Generative AI text generation**, suitable for academic learning, technical demonstrations, and introductory-level research or training programs.
